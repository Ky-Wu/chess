<strong>This is Kyle Wu's Ruby Chess project.</strong>

This project is my attempt to create a two-player chess game in the terminal for the final project of Section 3 of the Odin Project. 

Lessons I learned creating this:
Git: Commit early and often, and push at major points. I must admit that I'm a bit unfamilar with git, and thus I lost a significant
portion of commit history when my git repository was corrupted (git objs problems).
Also, I think it would've been helpful to write more specs.

Bugs:
Checkmate doesn't consider moving a piece to block attacks?
